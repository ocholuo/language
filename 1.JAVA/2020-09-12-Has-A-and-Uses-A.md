# Java - Has-A and Uses-A Relationship

[toc]

---

In Java, reuse code using an `Is-A relationship` or `Has-A relationship`.
- Is-A relationship is also known as inheritance
- Has-A relationship is also known as composition in Java.
- both used for code reusability in Java.


## Is-A Relationship in Java
- In Java, Is-A relationship depends on inheritance.
  - Further inheritance is of two types, `class inheritance` and `interface inheritance`.
- **inheritance is unidirectional in nature**.
  - a Potato is a vegetable, a Bus is a vehicle.
  - a house is a building.
  - But not all buildings are houses.
- determine an Is-A relationship in Java.
  - `extends` or `implement` keyword in the class declaration in Java
  - then the specific class is said to be following the Is-A relationship.


## Has-A Relationship in Java
- In Java, Has-A relationship is also known as composition.
- Has-A relationship: an instance of one class has a reference to an instance of another class or an other instance of the same class.
  - For example, a car has an engine, a dog has a tail and so on.
- In Java, there is no such keyword that implements a Has-A relationship. But we mostly use new keywords to implement a Has-A relationship in Java.

## code example

```java
package relationsdemo;  

public class Bike  {  
    private String color;  
    private int maxSpeed;  
    public void bikeInfo()  {  
        System.out.println("Bike Color= "+color + " Max Speed= " + maxSpeed);  
    }  
    public void setColor(String color)  {  
        this.color = color;  
    }  
    public void setMaxSpeed(int maxSpeed)  {  
        this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;  
    }  
}  

public class Engine  {  
    public void start() {  
        System.out.println("Started:");  
    }  
    public void stop() {  
        System.out.println("Stopped:");  
    }  
}


// ====================================================================


public class Pulsar extends Bike {     
// Pulsar is a type of bike that extends the Bike class that shows that Pulsar is a Bike.
// All the methods like setColor( ), bikeInfo( ), setMaxSpeed( ) are used because of the Is-A relationship of the Pulsar class with the Bike class.

    public void PulsarStartDemo() {  
        Engine PulsarEngine = new Engine();  
        // Pulsar also uses an Engine's method, stop, using composition.
        PulsarEngine.stop();  
    }  
}


// ====================================================================

public class Demo  {  
    public static void main(String[] args)  {  
        Pulsar myPulsar = new Pulsar();  
        myPulsar.setColor("BLACK");  
        myPulsar.setMaxSpeed(136);  
        myPulsar.bikeInfo();  
        myPulsar.PulsarStartDemo();  
    }  
}  


```
