type a web address into browser:

1. The browser goes to the DNS server, finds the real address of the server that the website lives on.
2. The browser sends an **HTTP request** message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using **TCP/IP**.
3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a **"200 OK" message**, and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets.
4. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it.
