URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
- specifies the location of a resource (such as a web page) on the internet. The URL also specifies how to retrieve that resource, also known as the "protocol", such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.

`protocol://domain-name.top-level-domain/path`

3 main benefits of URLs:
1. understand better the pages
2. memorize valuable packages
3. navigate faster
4. share easily
5. Improved user experience
