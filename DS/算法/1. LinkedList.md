## Linked List Data Structure

A linked list is a linear data structure
- the `elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations`. 
- The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

Advantages over arrays:
- Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
1. **Dynamic size**: `The size of the arrays is fixed`: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
2. **Ease of insertion/deletion**: `Inserting a new element` in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

Drawbacks:
1. `Random access is not allowed`. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here.
2. `Extra memory space for a pointer` is required with each element of the list.
3. `Not cache friendly`. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

```java
class LinkedList { 
	Node head; // head of list 

	/* Linked list Node. This inner class is made static so that 
	main() can access it */
	static class Node { 
		int data; 
        Node next; 
        
		Node(int d) { 
			data = d; 
			next = null; 
		} // Constructor 
	} 

	/* method to create a simple linked list with 3 nodes*/
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
		/* Start with the empty list. */
		LinkedList llist = new LinkedList(); 

		llist.head = new Node(1); 
		Node second = new Node(2); 
		Node third = new Node(3); 

		/* Three nodes have been allocated dynamically. 
		We have references to these three blocks as head, 
		second and third 

		llist.head	 second			 third

		llist.head.next = second; // Link first node with the second node 

		/* Now next of the first Node refers to the second. So they 
			both are linked. 

		llist.head	 second			 third

		second.next = third; // Link second node with the third node 

		/* Now next of the second Node refers to third. So all three 
			nodes are linked. 

		llist.head	 second			 third

## Linked List Traversal

created a simple linked list with three nodes. 
- Let us traverse the created list and print the data of each node. 
- For traversal, let us write a general-purpose function printList() that prints any given list.

```java
// A simple Java program for traversal of a linked list 
class LinkedList { 
	Node head; // head of list 

	/* Linked list Node. This inner class is made static so that 
	main() can access it */
	static class Node { 
		int data; 
		Node next; 
		Node(int d) { 
			data = d; 
			next = null; 
		} // Constructor 
	} 

	/* This function prints contents of linked list starting from head */
	public void printList() { 
		Node n = head; 
		while (n != null) { 
			System.out.print(n.data + " "); 
			n = n.next; 
		} 
	} 

	/* method to create a simple linked list with 3 nodes*/
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
		/* Start with the empty list. */
		LinkedList llist = new LinkedList(); 

		llist.head = new Node(1); 
		Node second = new Node(2); 
		Node third = new Node(3); 

		llist.head.next = second; // Link first node with the second node 
		second.next = third; // Link first node with the second node 

		llist.printList(); 
	} 
}
```
