# Introduction to Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
The idea is to `store multiple items of the same type together`. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

The above image can be looked as a top-level view of a staircase where you are at the base of the staircase. Each element can be uniquely identified by their index in the array (in a similar way as you could identify your friends by the step on which they were on in the above example).

Advantages of using arrays:
- Arrays `allow random access` of elements, makes accessing elements by position faster.
- Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.

```
// A character array in C/C++/Java
char arr1[] = {'g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's'};

// An Integer array in C/C++/Java
int arr2[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

Usually, an array of characters is called a ‘string’,
whereas an array of ints or floats is called simply an array.

# Arrays in Java


An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++. Following are some important point about Java arrays.

- In Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.
- arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using member length.
  - different from C/C++ where we find length using sizeof.
- A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
- The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index beginning from 0.
- Java array can be also be used as a static field, a local variable or a method parameter.
- The size of an array must be specified by an int value and not long or short.
- The direct superclass of an array type is Object.
- Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.


Array can contains primitives (int, char, etc) as well as object (or non-primitives) references of a class depending on the definition of array.
- In case of primitives data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- In case of objects of a class, the actual objects are stored in heap segment.

## Creating, Initializing, and Accessing an Array

One-Dimensional Arrays :
The general form of a one-dimensional array declaration is

```
type var-name[];
OR
type[] var-name;
```

An array declaration has two components:
- the type and the name.
- the element type for the array determines what type of data the array will hold.

```java
// both are valid declarations
int intArray[];
int[] intArray;

byte byteArray[];
short shortsArray[];
boolean booleanArray[];
long longArray[];
float floatArray[];
double doubleArray[];
char charArray[];

// an array of references to objects of
// the class MyClass (a class created by
// user)
MyClass myClassArray[];

Object[]  ao,        // array of Object
Collection[] ca;     // array of Collection of unknown type
```

Although declaration establishes the fact that intArray is an array variable,
- no array actually exists.
- It simply tells to the compiler that this(intArray) variable will hold an array of the integer type.
- To link intArray with an actual, physical array of integers, you must allocate one using `new` and assign it to intArray.

---

## Instantiating an Array in Java

When an array is declared, only a reference of array is created.
- To actually create or give memory to array,

`var-name = new type [size];`

- `type` specifies the type of data being allocated
- `size` specifies the number of elements in the array
- `var-name` is the name of array variable that is linked to the array.
- to use new to allocate an array, must specify the type and number of elements to allocate.

```java
int intArray[];    //declaring array
intArray = new int[20];  // allocating memory to array

OR

int[] intArray = new int[20]; // combining both statements in one
```

1. The elements in the array allocated by `new` will automatically be initialized to `zero (for numeric types)`, `false (for boolean)`, or `null (for reference types)`.
Refer Default array values in Java
2. Obtaining an array is a two-step process.
   - First, must declare a variable of the desired array type.  
   - Second, must allocate the memory that will hold the array, using `new`, and assign it to the array variable. Thus, in Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.

## Array Literal

In a situation, where the size of the array and variables of array are already known, array literals can be used.

```java
int[] intArray = new int[]{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 };
// Declaring array literal
```

- The length of this array determines the length of the created array.
- There is no need to write the new int[] part in the latest versions of Java

---

## Accessing Java Array Elements using for Loop

Each element in the array is accessed via its index.
- The index begins with 0 and ends at `array.length-1`.
- All the elements of array can be accessed using Java for Loop.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
  System.out.println(arr[i]);
}
```

## Arrays of Objects

An array of objects is created just like an array of primitive type data items in the following way.

```java
Class[] arr = new Class[7];
```

The studentArray contains seven memory spaces each of size of student class in which the address of seven Student objects can be stored.The Student objects have to be instantiated using the constructor of the Student class and their references should be assigned to the array elements in the following way.

```java
Student[] arr = new Student[5];

class Student {
    public int roll_no;
    public String name;

    Student(int roll_no, String name) {
        this.roll_no = roll_no;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

// Elements of array are objects of a class Student.
public class GFG {

    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Student[] arr;
        arr = new Student[5];

        // initialize the first elements of the array
        arr[0] = new Student(1,"aman");
        arr[1] = new Student(2,"vaibhav");
        arr[2] = new Student(3,"shikar");
        arr[3] = new Student(4,"dharmesh");
        arr[4] = new Student(5,"mohit");

        // accessing the elements of the specified array
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
            System.out.println("Element at " + i + " : " +
                        arr[i].roll_no +" "+ arr[i].name);
    }
}
```

## access element outside the array size?

JVM throws `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` to indicate that array has been accessed with an illegal index.
- The index is either negative or greater than or equal to size of array.

```java
class GFG {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int[] arr = new int[2];
        arr[0] = 10;
        arr[1] = 20;

        for (int i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++)
            System.out.println(arr[i]);
    }
}
// Runtime error
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 2
    at GFG.main(File.java:12)
// Output:
10
20
```


---


## Multidimensional Arrays

Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays with each element of the array holding the reference of other array.
- These are also known as `Jagged Arrays`.
- A multidimensional array is created by appending one set of square brackets ([]) per dimension.

```java
int[][] intArray = new int[10][20];       //a 2D array or matrix
int[][][] intArray = new int[10][20][10]; //a 3D array


class multiDimensional {
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // declaring and initializing 2D array
        int arr[][] = { {2,7,9},{3,6,1},{7,4,2} };

        // printing 2D array
        for (int i=0; i< 3 ; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j < 3 ; j++)
                System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
// Output:
2 7 9
3 6 1
7 4 2
```

---

## Passing Arrays to Methods

```java
// pass array to method sum for calculating sum of array’s values.

class Test {     

    public static void sum(int[] arr)  {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            sum+=arr[i];
        }
        System.out.println("sum of array values : " + sum);
    }


    public static void main(String args[])  {
        int arr[] = {3, 1, 2, 5, 4};
        sum(arr);
    }


}
```

---

## Returning Arrays from Methods

- a method can return an array.
- For example, below program returns an array from method m1.

```java
class Test {     

    // Driver method
    public static void main(String args[])  {
        int arr[] = m1();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
    }

    public static int[] m1()  {
        // returning  array
        return new int[]{1,2,3};
    }
}
// Output:
1 2 3
```

---

## Class Objects for Arrays

Every array has an associated Class object, shared with all other arrays with the same component type.

```java
class Test
{  
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {
        int intArray[] = new int[3];
        byte byteArray[] = new byte[3];
        short shortsArray[] = new short[3];

        // array of Strings
        String[] strArray = new String[3];

        System.out.println(intArray.getClass());
        System.out.println(intArray.getClass().getSuperclass());
        System.out.println(byteArray.getClass());
        System.out.println(shortsArray.getClass());
        System.out.println(strArray.getClass());
    }
}
// Output:
// class [I
// class java.lang.Object
// class [B
// class [S
// class [Ljava.lang.String;

// Explanation :
// The string “[I” is the run-time type signature for the class object “array with component type int“.
// The only direct superclass of any array type is java.lang.Object.
// The string “[B” is the run-time type signature for the class object “array with component type byte“.
// The string “[S” is the run-time type signature for the class object “array with component type short“.
// The string “[L” is the run-time type signature for the class object “array with component type of a Class”. The Class name is then followed.
```

## Array Members

arrays are object of a class and direct superclass of arrays is class Object.
The members of an array type are all of the following:
- The public final field `length`, which contains the number of components of the array. length may be positive or zero.
- All the members inherited from class `Object`; the only method of Object that is not inherited is its `clone` method.
- The public method `clone()`, which overrides clone method in class Object and throws no checked exceptions.


## Cloning of arrays

When you clone a single dimensional array, such as Object[], a “deep copy” is performed with the new array containing copies of the original array’s elements as opposed to references.

```java
class Test{

    public static void main(String args[])  {

        int intArray[] = {1,2,3};
        int cloneArray[] = intArray.clone();
        // will print false as deep copy is created
        // for one-dimensional array
        System.out.println(intArray == cloneArray);

        for (int i = 0; i < cloneArray.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(cloneArray[i]+" ");
        }
    }
}
// Output:
// false
// 1 2 3
```

A clone of a `multidimensional array` (like Object[][]) is a “shallow copy” however, which is to say that it creates only a single new array with each element array a reference to an original element array but subarrays are shared.

```java
class Test{     
    public static void main(String args[])  {
        int intArray[][] = {{1,2,3},{4,5}};
        int cloneArray[][] = intArray.clone();

        // will print false
        System.out.println(intArray == cloneArray);

        // will print true
        // as shallow copy is created
        // i.e. sub-arrays are shared
        System.out.println(intArray[0] == cloneArray[0]);
        System.out.println(intArray[1] == cloneArray[1]);
    }
}
```
