## from kraken import pageseg


1. simple two column text and then a list of lists which are the bounding boxes of lines of that text.

    ```py
    from kraken import pageseg
    from PIL import Image

    im=Image.open("readonly/two_col.png")

    # display the image inline
    display(im)

    # convert it to black and white
    # segment it up into lines with kraken
    bounding_boxes=pageseg.segment(im.convert('1'))['boxes']

    # print those lines to the screen
    print(bounding_boxes)
    ```

```

2. make it clear

    ```py
    def show_boxes(img):
        # bring in ImageDraw object
        from PIL import ImageDraw
        # grab a drawing object to annotate that image
        drawing_object=ImageDraw.Draw(img)

        # create boxes using pageseg.segment
        bounding_boxes=pageseg.segment(img.convert('1'))['boxes']


        for box in bounding_boxes:
            # draw a nice rectangle
            drawing_object.rectangle(box, fill = None, outline ='red')
        # And to make it easy, lets return the image object
        return img

    # display
    display(show_boxes(Image.open("readonly/two_col.png")))
    ```

3. seperate the gap

```py

# the black_colseps parameter. If set to True, kraken will assume that columns will be separated by black lines. This isn't our case here, but, can change the source image to have a black separator between columns.

def show_boxes(img):
    '''Modifies the passed image to show a series of bounding boxes on an image as run by kraken
    :param img: A PIL.Image object
    :return img: The modified PIL.Image object
    '''

    from PIL import ImageDraw
    drawing_object=ImageDraw.Draw(img)

    # create a set of boxes using pageseg.segment
    bounding_boxes=pageseg.segment(img.convert('1'), black_colseps=True)['boxes']


    for box in bounding_boxes:
        drawing_object.rectangle(box, fill = None, outline ='red')   # draw a rectangle
    return img

display(show_boxes(Image.open("readonly/two_col.png")))



# to detect a white column separator.
# add the separator if the space of was at least 25 pixels wide, roughly the width of a character, and six lines high.
# The width is easy, lets just make a variable
char_width=25



# The height is harder, since it depends on the height of the text. I'm going to write a routine
# to calculate the average height of a line
def calculate_line_height(img):
    '''Calculates the average height of a line from a given image
    :param img: A PIL.Image object
    :return: The average line height in pixels
    '''

    bounding_boxes=pageseg.segment(img.convert('1'))['boxes']
    # Each box is a tuple of (top, left, bottom, right)
    # the height: top - bottom
    height_accumulator=0
    for box in bounding_boxes:
        height_accumulator=height_accumulator+box[3]-box[1]
        # this is a bit tricky, remember that we start counting at the upper left corner in PIL!
    # now lets just return the average height
    # lets change it to the nearest full pixel by making it an integer
    return int(height_accumulator/len(bounding_boxes))

line_height=calculate_line_height(Image.open("readonly/two_col.png")) # 31


# scan through the image - looking at each pixel in turn - to determine if there is a block of whitespace.
gap_box=(0,0,char_width,line_height*6)



# It seems we will want to have a function which, given a pixel in an image, can check to see
# if that pixel has whitespace to the right and below it. Essentially, we want to test to see
# if the pixel is the upper left corner of something that looks like the gap_box. If so, then
# we should insert a line to "break up" this box before sending to kraken

def gap_check(img, location):
    '''Checks the img in a given (x,y) location to see if it fits the description of a gap_box

    '''
    # Recall that we can get a pixel using the img.getpixel() function. It returns this value
    # as a tuple of integers, one for each color channel. Our tools all work with binarized
    # images (black and white), so we should just get one value. If the value is 0 it's a black
    # pixel, if it's white then the value should be 255
    #
    # We're going to assume that the image is in the correct mode already, e.g. it has been
    # binarized. The algorithm to check our bounding box is fairly easy: we have a single location
    # which is our start and then we want to check all the pixels to the right of that location
    # up to gap_box[2]
    for x in range(location[0], location[0]+gap_box[2]):
        # the height is similar, so lets iterate a y variable to gap_box[3]
        for y in range(location[1], location[1]+gap_box[3]):

    # then we can return true -- this is a gap!
    return True


# once find a gap, draw a line in the middle of it.
def draw_sep(img,location):
    '''Draws a line in img in the middle of the gap discovered at location. Note that
    this doesn't draw the line in location, but draws it at the middle of a gap_box
    starting at location.

    '''
    # First lets bring in all of our drawing code

    x1=location[0]+int(gap_box[2]/2)
    # and our x2 is just the same thing, since this is a one pixel vertical line
    x2=x1
    # our starting y coordinate is just the y coordinate which was passed in, the top of the box
    y1=location[1]
    # but we want our final y coordinate to be the bottom of the box

## Comparing Image Data Structures

1. reads an image and converts it into greyscale.

```py
# import the open cv package cv2
import cv2 as cv
# oad the floyd.jpg image
img = cv.imread('readonly/floyd.jpg')
# convert it to grayscale
gray = cv.cvtColor(img, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

import inspect
inspect.getmro(type(gray))
# [numpy/ndarray, object]
```


```py
gray
```

```py
# The array is shown here as a list of lists, where the inner lists are filled with integers.
# The dtype=uint8 definition indicates that each of the items in an array is an 8 bit unsigned
# integer, which is very common for black and white images.
# this is a pixel by pixel definition of the image.
#
# The display package doesn't know what to do with this image.
# convert it into a PIL object to render it in the browser.
from PIL import Image
# "L" is just an array of luminance values in unsigned integers
image = Image.fromarray(gray, "L")
display(image)

```py
# Numpy arrays are multidimensional.
# For instance, define an array in a single dimension:
import numpy as np
single_dim = np.array([25, 50 , 25, 10, 10])

# In an image, this is analagous to a single row of 5 pixels each in grayscale.
# But actually, all imaging libraries tend to expect at least two dimensions, width and heigh
# if put the single_dim inside of another array, this would be a two dimensional array with element in the height direction, and five in the width direction
double_dim = np.array([single_dim])

double_dim
display(Image.fromarray(double_dim, "L"))

## OpenCV


OpenCV comes with trained models for detecting faces, eyes, and smiles


## detect face

```py
import cv2 as cv
face_cascade = cv.CascadeClassifier('readonly/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
eye_cascade = cv.CascadeClassifier('readonly/haarcascade_eye.xml')

img = cv.imread('readonly/floyd.jpg')
# convert it to grayscale using the cvtColor image
gray = cv.cvtColor(img, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)


# to use the face_cascade classifier
# use the detectMultiScale() function.
# returns a list of objects as rectangles. The first parameter is an ndarray of the image.
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print those faces out to the screen
faces
```

![Screen Shot 2020-08-26 at 12.30.03](https://i.imgur.com/DoMIHnX.png)

```py
faces.tolist()[0]
```

![Screen Shot 2020-08-26 at 12.31.48](https://i.imgur.com/U8lCcYt.png)

```py
# (x,y,w,h)
# upper left hand point for the image
# the width and height represent the bounding box.


from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageDraw

# create a PIL image object
pil_img=Image.fromarray(gray,mode="L")
drawing=ImageDraw.Draw(pil_img)

# pull the rectangle out of the faces object
rec=faces.tolist()[0]

# Now we just draw a rectangle around the bounds
drawing.rectangle(rec, outline="white")

# And display
display(pil_img)
```
