# 24.6. Fetching a page

The web works with a metaphor of “pages”.

The `browser` is just a computer program that <font color=drgrenn> fetches the contents and displays them </font> in a nice way.
- see the contents in plain text: select View source in your browser.

## 24.6.1. `requests.get` Fetching data

use a browser to fetch the contents of a page

module `requests`: use the `get` function to fetch the contents of a page.


page = requests.get("url")
- not working all the time. can't use it to fetch regular html pages like umich.edu.
- there are security considerations built into most web browsers called cross site scripting restrictions.

```py

import requests
import json

page = requests.get("https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny")
print(type(page))
#<class 'requests.Response'>

print(page.text[:150]) # print the first 150 characters
#[{"word":"money","score":4417,"numSyllables":2},{"word":"honey","score":1208,"numSyllables":2},{"word":"sunny","score":720,"numSyllables":2},{"word":"

print(page.url) # print the url that was fetched
#https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny

x = page.json() # turn page.text into a python object
x = jsno.loads(page, text)
print(type(x))
#<class 'list'>

print("---first item in the list---")
print(x[0])
print("---the whole list, pretty printed---")
print(json.dumps(x, indent=2)) # pretty print the results

```

## 24.6.3. Using requests.get to encode URL parameters

The `get` function in the `requests` module takes an optional parameter called `params`.

If a value is specified for that parameter, it should be a dictionary. The keys and values in that dictionary are used to append something to the URL that is requested from the remote site.

For example, in the following, the base url is https://google.com/search. A dictionary with two parameters is passed. Thus, the whole url is that base url, plus a question mark, “?”, plus a “q=…” and a “tbm=…” separated by an “&”.

the final url is: `https://www.google.com/search?q=%22violins+and+guitars%22&tbm=isch`

Actually, because dictionary keys are unordered in python, the final url might sometimes have the encoded key-value pairs in the other order: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=%22violins+and+guitars%22.

Fortunately, most websites that accept URL parameters in this form will accept the key-value pairs in any order.

```py

results = requests.get("base url", params=dictionary)

1.
    page = requests.get("https://www.google.com/search?q=%22violins+and+guitars%22&tbm=isch")

2. fetched url

    kval_pairs = {'rel_rhy': 'funny'}
    pages = requests.get("https://api.datamuse.com/words", params=kval_pairs)
    print(page.text[:150])
    print(page.url)  # print the url that was fetched


    d = {'q': '"violins and guitars"', 'tbm': 'isch'}
    results = requests.get("https://google.com/search", params=d)
    print(results.url)
    print(results.text)
    #
    https://www.google.com/search?q=%22violins+and+guitars%22&tbm=isch
    Filed to retrieve that URL   # browser security measure



3. request the URL

    http://bar.com/goodstuff?greet=hi+there&frosted=no

    requests.get("http://bar.com/goodstuff", params = {'greet': 'hi there', 'frosted':'no'})


4. extract the contents into a python dictionary or list

    # .json() invokes the json method
    resp.json()

    # loads turns a json-formatted string into a list or dictionary
    json.loads(resp.url)
```
