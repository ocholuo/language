# 24.8. Figuring Out How to Use a REST API

[toc]

## introduces

five questions that you’ll need to answer.
- What is the baseurl?
- What keys should you provide in the dictionary you pass for the params parameter?
- What values should you provide associated with those keys?
- Do you need to authenticate yourself as a licensed user of the API and, if so, how?
- What is the structure and meaning of the data that will be provided?




## 24.8.1. Example: the datamuse API

how to fatched a URL:

website [datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/): The Datamuse API is a word-finding query engine for developers. You can use it in your apps to find words that match a given set of constraints and that are likely in a given context. You can specify a wide variety of constraints on meaning, spelling, sound, and vocabulary in your queries, in any combination.

will seen example of a full URL
- `https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny`


- What keys should you provide in the dictionary you pass for the params parameter?
- What values should you provide associated with those keys?
- Do you need to authenticate yourself as a licensed user of the API and, if so, how?
- What is the structure and meaning of the data that will be provided?

**What is the baseurl?**

<font color=red> the first part </font> of the URL: `https://api.datamuse.com`

<font color=red> endpoints </font>: characters after the / and before the ?: words or sug.

Thus, the `baseurl` will be one of the two endpoints
- `https://api.datamuse.com/words`
- or `https://api.datamuse.com/sug`

**What keys should you provide in the dictionary you pass for the params parameter?**

**What values should you provide associated with those keys?**

The answers to questions two and three, about the contents of the value of the params dictionary, can be found in the section of the documentation that describes the particular `endpoint`.

For example, take a look at the documentation for the “words” endpoint.
{"word":"money","score":4417,"numSyllables":2},{"word":"honey","score":1208,"numSyllables":2},

The entire request will return some words, and all of the params contents will specify constraints that restrict the search.

- If the url includes `ml=funny`, then all the words that will be returned will `“have a meaning related to”` to the word funny.
- If the url includes `rel_cns=book`, then all the words returned will have “`Consonant match`” to “book”.


The words to the left of the =, like ml and rel_cns and rel_rhy, will be keys in the dictionary that you pass as the value of params in the call to requests.get. The values associated with those keys will be words, like book and funny.

**Do you need to authenticate yourself as a licensed user of the API and, if so, how?**


Many <font color=dblue> providers of APIs </font> require you to register in advance to make use of an API, and then authenticate yourself with each request.
- charge money, or restrict usage in some way.

A popular form of authentication is to have a personal `“api_key”` that you pass as one of the `key=value` pairs in the URL.

For example, the <font color=dblue> flickr API </font> requires that

Some services, such as Facebook and Twitter, require an even more complex, and secure, form of authentication, where a credential is used to cryptographically sign requests. it is considerably harder to debug.

Currently, datamuse does not require any authentication. You can tell that because, in the section titled “Usage limits”, it states, “You can use this service without restriction and without an API key for up to 100,000 requests per day. Please be aware that beyond that limit, keyless requests may be rate-limited without notice. If you’d like to use this in a customer-facing application, or if you need a custom vocabulary, or if you plan to make more than 100,000 requests per day, you can get an API key and a stable version to use with a greater availability guarantee.”

**What is the structure and meaning of the data that will be provided?**

the datamuse documentation provides a section “Interpreting the results”
- explains what kind of data will be returned by the API.
- the structure: JSON-formatted list of dictionaries, where each dictionary provides a single word that satisfies the hard constraints in the query, and a score saying how good a match it is on the soft constraints.

## 24.8.2. Defining a function to make repeated invocations


a computer program: automatically translate paragraphs of text into paragraphs with similar meanings but with more rhymes.
- contact the datamuse API repeatedly, passing different values associated with the key `rel_rhy`.

`https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny`

define a function to make request to a REST API for data
- means write less repeated code to make a request to the same API more than once in the same program.
- writing functions to complete a complex process in your code makes it easier to read and easier to fix later.
- Because a lot of things stay the same among different requests to the same API.


```py
# import statements for necessary Python modules
import requests

def get_rhymes(word):
    baseurl = "https://api.datamuse.com/words"
    params_diction = {} # Set up an empty dictionary for query parameters

    params_diction["rel_rhy"] = word
    params_diction["max"] = "3" # get at most 3 results

    # the fetched URL
    resp = requests.get(baseurl, params=params_diction)

    # return the top three words
    word_ds = resp.json()

    # return 2选1

    # return the value of key `word`
    return [d['word'] for d in word_ds]
    # Return a python object (a list of dictionaries in this case)
    return resp.json()
    #[{'word': 'money', 'score': 4417, 'numSyllables': 2}, {'word': 'honey', 'score': 1208, 'numSyllables': 2}, {'word': 'sunny', 'score': 720, 'numSyllables': 2}]


print(get_rhymes("funny"))
https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=funny

print(get_rhymes("dash"))
https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_rhy=dash
```
