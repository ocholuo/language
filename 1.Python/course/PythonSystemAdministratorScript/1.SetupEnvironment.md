From the linuxacademy: [Python 3 Scripting for System Administrators](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/1680/lesson/1)


## Set up Cloud Server


Required Software Packages, Tools, and Files
git
wget
which
words (need file at /usr/share/dict/words)
lsof
text editor of your choice
python 3.6.5


1. Installing Packages
```c
$ sudo su -
$ yum update
$ yum groupinstall -y "development tools"
$ yum install -y lsof wget vim-enhanced words which

$ yum install -y \
libffi-devel \
zlib-devel \
bzip2-devel \
openssl-devel \
ncurses-devel \
sqlite-devel \
readline-devel \
tk-devel \
gdbm-devel \
db4-devel \
libpcap-devel \
xz-devel \
expat-devel

db4-devel libpcap-devel

centos8:
$ yum install -y libffi-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel xz-devel expat-devel

```

2. Configuring Git
```c
$ git config --global user.name "ocholito"
$ git config --global user.email "grace@hotmail.com"

~ $ mkdir sample
~ $ cd sample/
sample $ touch file.txt

sample $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/server/sample/.git/
sample $ git add --all .

sample $ git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   file.txt

sample $ git commit -m "Added new file"
[master (root-commit) 583cf74] Added new file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 file.txt

sample[master] $ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


3. Customizing Bash (option, change the bash)
```c
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-python3-sysadmin/master/helpers/bashrc -o ~/.bashrc

// download the file
// rename it
// place it in the proper directory:
```


4. Customizing Vim
```c
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-python3-sysadmin/master/helpers/vimrc -o ~/.vimrc
```

5. install python
```c
1. in centos8

$ cd /usr/src
$ wget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/Python-3.6.4.tar.xz
$ tar xf Python-3.6.4.tar.xz
$ cd Python-3.6.4
$ ./configure --enable-optimizations
$ make altinstall

// Important: make altinstall causes it to not replace the built in python executable.
```

6. upgrade pip
```c
$ sudo pip3.6 install --upgrade pip

//Ensure that secure_path in /etc/sudoers file includes /usr/local/bin.
//The line should look something like this:
// use / to search

sudo vim /etc/sudoers
Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
```

Key Points About Python:

- Object-Oriented Scripting Language.
- Dynamic & strong typing system.
- Dynamic types are checked at runtime
- Strong types don’t change implicitly, can’t add 1 and "something".
- Supports functional concepts like map, reduce, filter, and list comprehension.
- Whitespace delimited (no { or } around code blocks)
- Pseudo-code like syntax
- Extremely popular language used across many different disciplines (academia, data science, scripting, web development, etc.).
- Large open source community and public package index (Pypi).
- Runs on all major operating systems (historically more of a pain to run on Windows than Unix systems). Pre-installed on most `*NIX` systems (usually Python 2).
- Supported by large companies such as Google & YouTube.
- Consistently high on the Tiobe Index (one of the most searched programming languages). 4th as of the time of recording this.
- Placed in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey’s top 10 for Most Popular Programming Languages, Most Loved Programming Languages, and placed number 1 as the “Most Wanted Language” (the language that developers want to use the most).
