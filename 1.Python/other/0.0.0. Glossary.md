# Glossary

`accumulator pattern`
- A pattern where the program initializes an `accumulator variable` and then changes it during each iteration, accumulating a final result.

`activecode`
A unique interpreter environment that allows Python to be executed from within a web browser.

`algorithm`
A step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.

`argument`
- A value provided to a function when the function is called. This value is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.
- The argument can be the result of an expression which may involve operators, operands and calls to other fruitful functions.



`assignment token`
- `=` is Python’s assignment token, which should not be confused with the mathematical comparison operator using the same symbol.

`attribute`
- One of the named data items that makes up an instance.




`block`
- A group of consecutive statements with the same indentation.

`body`
- The block of statements in a `compound statement` that follows the `header`.
- The second part of a compound statement.
- The body consists of a sequence of statements all indented the same amount from the beginning of the header. The standard amount of indentation used within the Python community is 4 spaces.

`boolean expression`
- An expression that is either true or false.

`boolean value`
- There are exactly two boolean values: True and False. Boolean values result when a boolean expression is evaluated by the Python interepreter. They have type bool.


`branch`
- One of the possible paths of the flow of execution determined by conditional execution.


`bug`
An error in a program.




`byte code`
- An intermediate language between `source code` and `object code`. Many modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then interpret the byte code with a program called a virtual machine.


`calling stack`
- A sequence (stack) of frames, showing all the function calls that are in process but not yet complete. When one function’s code invokes another function call, there will be more than one frame on the stack.

`class`
- A user-defined compound type. A class can also be thought of as a template for the objects that are instances of it.



`compound statement`
- A statement that consists of two parts:
  - `header`: begins with a keyword determining the statement type, and ends with a colon.
  - `body`: containing one or more statements indented the same amount from the header.
- The syntax of a compound statement looks like this:
    ```py
    keyword expression:
        statement
        statement
        ...
    ```

`condition`
The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed.
- `chained conditional`
  - A conditional branch with more than two possible flows of execution. `if ... elif ... else statements`.
- `conditional statement`
  - A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition. keywords `if, elif, and else` are used for conditional statements.

`constructor`
- Every class has a “factory”, called by the same name as the class, for making new instances. If the class has an initializer method, this method is used to get the attributes (i.e. the state) of the new object properly set up.


`class`
- see data type below

`close()`
- When you are done with a file, you should close it.

`codelens`

`Control Flow`
Also known as the `flow of execution`, the order in which a program executes. By default, the control flow is *sequential*.

`data type`
A set of values. The type of a value determines how it can be used in expressions. So far, the types you have seen are integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and strings (str).

  - *syntax error*,
  - *semantic error*,
  - and *runtime error*.

`executable`
- Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.

`float`
- A Python data type which stores floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers are stored internally in two parts: a base and an exponent. When printed in the standard format, they look like decimal numbers. Beware of rounding errors when you use floats, and remember that they are only approximate values.

`flow of execution`
- The order in which statements are executed during a program run.

---

`for loop traversal (for)`
- Traversing a string or a list means accessing each character in the string or item in the list, one at a time.

- executes the body of the loop severous times with different values of ix each time.
- A variable or value used to select a member of an ordered collection, such as a character from a string, or an element from a list.
- The loop body contains the statements of the program that will be iterate through upon each loop. The loop body is always indented.


`formal language`
Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages.


`function`
- A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation.

`initialization (of a variable)`
To initialize a variable is to give it an initial value. variables don’t exist until they are assigned values, they are initialized when they are created. In other programming languages this is not the case, and variables can be created without being initialized, in which case they have either default or garbage values.

`initializer method`

`literal`
- A number or string that is written directly in a program. Sometimes these are also referred to as literal values, or just values, but be careful not to confuse a literal value as written in a program with an internal value maintained by the Python interpreter during execution of a program.


`lifetime`
- Variables and objects have lifetimes — they are created at some point during program execution, and will be destroyed at some time.
- In python, `objects` live as long as there is some variable pointing to it, or it is part of some other compound object, like a list or a dictionary.
- In python, `local variables` live only until the function finishes execution.


`local variable`
- A variable defined inside a function. A local variable can only be used inside its function.

`object`
- Also known as a `data object/value`. The fundamental things that programs are designed to manipulate (or that programmers ask to do things for them).
- A compound data type that is often used to model a thing or concept in the real world. It bundles together the data and the operations that are relevant for that kind of data. Instance and object are used interchangeably.

Shell mode is initiated by opening the terminal of your operating system and typing “python”. Press enter and the Python Shell will appear. This is in contrast to source code. Also see the entry under Python shell.


`side effect`
- Some lasting effect of a function call, other than its return value.
- Side effects include `print statements`, `changes to mutable objects`, and `changes to the values of global variables`.


`stack frame`
- A frame that keeps track of the values of local variables during a function execution, and where to return control when the function execution completes.

`.sort()`

`sorted()`
- A function that returns a sorted list, without changing the original.
  - reverse parameter
    - If True, the sorting is done in reverse order.
  - key parameter
    - If a value is specified, it must be a function object that takes one parameter. The function will be called once for each item in the list that’s getting sorted. The return value will be used to decorate the item with a post-it note. Values on the post-it notes are used to determine the sort order of the items.

`variable name`
A name given to a variable. Variable names in Python consist of a sequence of letters `(a..z, A..Z, and _)` and digits (0..9) that begins with a letter. In best programming practice, variable names should be chosen so that they describe their use in the program, making the program self documenting.


`write()`
