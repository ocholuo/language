# 206. Reverse Linked List

# Reverse a singly linked list.

# Example:
# Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
# Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

# Follow up:
# A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?



# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next


# solution 1 ----------------------------- linea 3 point
# Time complexity = O(n)
# Space compexity - O(1)
