```py
class student(object):

    def __init__(self, name, score):   # 强制填写
        self.name=name
        self.score=score

    def print_score(self):
        print("%s:%s" % (self.name, self.score))

    def get_grade(self):
        if self.score >= 90:
            return 'A'
        if self.score >= 60:

        else:
            return 'C'
```


## intro

some functions maybe repeated in code many times.

`function`:
- a chunk of code that performs some operation that is meaningful for a person to think about as a whole unit,
- a named sequence of statements.

- 函数是组织好的，可重复使用的，用来实现单一，或相关联功能的代码段。
- 函数能提高应用的模块性，和代码的重复利用率。
- Python提供了许多 *内建函数*，比如print()。
- 但也可以自己创建函数，这被叫做 *用户自定义函数*。


---

## 12.2. Function Definition

creating a function, a function definition, is:

```py
def name( parameters ):
    statements

>>> print(type(name))
<class 'function'>
```

- the `parameters` specify what the function needs to do its work.
- There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the `def`.
- also a compound statements:
  - A `header` line: begins with a keyword `def`,  followed by the `name` of the function, and some `parameter` names enclosed in parentheses, and ends with a `colon`.
  - A `body`: consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same amount – 4 spaces is the Python standard – from the header line.
- `docstrings`
  - 函数的第一行语句可以选择性地使用文档字符串—用于存放函数说明。
  - If the first thing after the function header is a string (some tools insist that it must be a triple-quoted string), it is called a `docstring` and gets special treatment in Python and in some of the programming tools.
  - Another way to retrieve this information: use the interactive interpreter, enter  `<function_name>.__doc__`, it will retrieve the `docstring` for the function.
  - So the string you write as documentation at the start of a function is retrievable by python tools at runtime. This is different from comments in your code, which are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.

By convention, Python programmers use docstrings for the key documentation of their functions.

---

## 12.3. Function Invocation 函数调用

after define, to execute the function, use `function call/invocation`.

- 定义函数：给了函数一个名称，指定了函数里包含的参数，和代码块结构。
- 这个函数的基本结构完成以后，可以通过另一个函数调用执行，也可以直接从 Python 命令提示符执行。

```py
def name( formal/actual parameters / parameter values ):
    statements
```

This type of diagram is often called a `black-box diagram` because it only states the requirements from the perspective of the user
- The user must know the name of the function and what arguments need to be passed.
- The details of how the function works are hidden inside the “black-box”.


```py
def add(a,b):
    total = a+b
    a = 17   
    # string immutable, will not change
    return total

def add_list(alist):
    total = 0
    for i in alist:
      total+=i
    list.append("3")  
    # list mutable, will change
    return total

mynum=11
add(mynum, 3)  # (11,3) actual parameter
```

```py
调用函数时可使用的正式参数类型：
- 必需参数
def printme(str):

- 关键字参数
def printme(name, age):

- 默认参数
def printinfo( name, age = 35):

- 不定长参数   
def name([formal_args,]*var_args_tuple):

```

---

## 12.5. `return value` from a function

`procedure`: function that doesn’t return a value.

`fruitful functions`: Functions that return values.
- The return statement is followed by an expression which is evaluated
- `return [表达式]` 结束函数，选择性地返回一个值给调用方。不带表达式的return相当于返回 None。


```py
def name(parameter):
  statements
  return 3

get_value = name(parameter) = 3
# get the return value

def name(parameter):
  statements
  3

get_value = name(parameter) = None
# get None
```


A `return` statement, once executed, immediately terminates execution of a function, even if it is not the last statement in the function.
- Once the function gets to the return statement it will immediately stop executing the function.


```py

1.
    def weird():
        print("here")
        return 5
        print("there")
        return 10

    x = weird()
    print(x)

    when line 3 executes, the value 5 is returned and assigned to the variable x, then printed.
    Lines 4 and 5 never execute.

2.
    def longer_than_five(list_of_names):
        for name in list_of_names:
            if len(name) > 5: # as soon as you see a name longer than 5 letters,
                return True
                # then return True!
                # If Python executes that return statement, the function is over and the rest of the code will not run -- you already have your answer!
        return False
        # You will only get to this line if you
        # iterated over the whole list and did not get a name where
        # the if expression evaluated to True, so at this point, it's correct to return False!
    list1 = ["Sam","Tera","Sal","Amita"]
    list2 = ["Rey","Ayo","Lauren","Natalie"]

    print(longer_than_five(list1))
    print(longer_than_five(list2))

```

## 12.8. Variables and parameters are local¶

![Screen Shot 2020-03-21 at 14.21.38](https://i.imgur.com/mMO3pJC.png)


![Screen Shot 2020-03-21 at 14.21.05](https://i.imgur.com/1hVw556.png)

y=x*x, `return y`

avoid the temporary variable y: `return x*x`
- `temporary variables` inside are referred to as `local variables`

the `global variables` and the `local variables `for the square function are in separate boxes. can have same name.
- `local variable` only exists inside the function and you cannot use it outside.
- It is legal for a function to access a `global variable`. However, this is considered bad form and should be avoided.

```py
def square(x):
    y = x * x
    return y

z = square(10)
print(y)

NameError: name 'y' is not defined on line 6
```

---

### variable's scope:
- rule about how variables are looked up in Python.
- First, Python looks at the variables that are defined as `local variables` in the function. the `local scope`.
- If the variable name is not found in the `local scope`, then Python looks at the `global variables`, `global scope`.

```py

1. pass all parameter to the function:

    def badsquare(x):
        y = x ** power
        # 1. function should pass power as a parameter.
        return y
    power = 2
    result = badsquare(10)
    print(result)


2. local shadows the global.

    def powerof(x,p):
        power = p   # mistake
        y = x ** power
        return y
    power = 3
    7	result = powerof(10,2)

    Global frame:
    powerof	---   function powerof(x,p)
    power 	3
    result	100

the local shadows the global:
- a local variable has the same name as a global variable
- A shadow: means that the global variable cannot be accessed by Python because the local variable will be found first.
- This is another good reason not to use global variables. As you can see, it makes your code confusing and difficult to understand.


3. change the value of a global variable inside a function

    def powerof(x,p):
        global power # bad idea, but valid
        power = p    # mistake
        y = x ** power
        return y
    power = 3
    print(powerof(10,2))

    Global frame:
    powerof	---   function powerof(x,p)
    power 	2  
    # change the value of a global variable inside a function
    result	100
```

> Note
> Generally, we do not recommend making variables global.
> Imagine you are trying to write a program that keeps track of money while purchasing groceries. You may make a variable that represents how much money the person has, called wallet. You also want to make a function called purchase, which will take the name of the item and its price, and then add the item to a list of groceries, and deduct the price from the amount stored in wallet. If you initialize wallet before the function as a variable within the global scope instead of passing it as a third parameter for purchase, then an error would occur because wallet would not be found in the local scope. Though there are ways to get around this, as outlined in this page, if your program was supposed to handle groceries for multiple people, then you would need to declare each wallet as a global variable in the functions that want to use wallet, and that would become very confusing and tedious to deal with.
---

## 12.14. Side Effects

`side effect`
- Some lasting effect of a function call, other than its return value.
- Side effects include
  - `print statements`
  - `changes to mutable objects`
  - `changes to the values of global variables`

Side effects are sometimes convenient.
- For example
- have a single dictionary that accumulates information, and pass it around to various functions that modify it.

```py
def double(n):
   global y
   y = 2 * n

y = 5
double(y) # 10
```

but can be very difficult to debug.
- better way:

```py
def double(n):
   return 2 * n

y = 5
y = double(y)
print(y)
```

- You can avoid confusing `side effects` with `sharing of mutable objects`.
  - make a copy of an object and pass the copy in to the function.
  - Then return the modified copy
  - reassign it to the original variable to save the changes.

```py
1	def changeit(lst):
2	   lst[0] = "Michigan"
3	   lst[1] = "Wolverines"
4	   return lst
5
6	mylst = ['106', 'students', 'are', 'awesome']
7	newlst = changeit(list(mylst))
8	print(mylst)
9	print(newlst)
```

## Preventing a Function from Modifying a List

function_name(list_name[:])

## Arbitrary

### Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments

won’t know how many arguments a function needs to accept
- Python allows a function to collect an arbitrary number of arguments from the calling statement.

The asterisk in the parameter name `*toppings` tells Python to make an `empty tuple` called toppings and pack whatever values it receives into this tuple.

```py
def make_pizza(*toppings):
    print("\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")

make_pizza('pepperoni')
# Making a pizza with the following toppings:
# - pepperoni

make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
# Making a pizza with the following toppings:
# - mushrooms
# - green peppers
# - extra cheese

def make_pizza(size, *toppings):
    print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

### Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments

won’t know what kind of information will be passed to the function.
- write functions that accept `as many key-value pairs as the calling statement provides`.

```py
def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):
    user_info['first_name'] = first
    user_info['last_name'] = last
    return user_info

user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein', location='princeton', field='physics')

print(user_profile)
# {'location': 'princeton', 'field': 'physics', 'first_name': 'albert', 'last_name': 'einstein'}
```

---

## 12.6. 👩‍💻 Decoding a Function

build your understanding of any function:
- How many parameters does it have?
- What is the type of values that will be passed when the function is invoked?
- What is the type of the return value that the function produces when it executes?

some clues:
- `len(x)`: x must be a string/list/dictionary. x can’t be a number/Boolean.
- `x - y`: x and y must be numbers (integer or float)
- `x + y`: x and y must both be numbers/strings/lists.
- `x[3]`: x must be a string/list containing at least four items, or a dictionary that includes 3 as a key.
- `x['3']`: x must be a dictionary, with ‘3’ as a key.
- `x[y:z]`, x must be a sequence (string/list), and y and z must be integers.
- `x and y`, x and y must be Boolean
- `for x in y`, y must be a sequence (string/list) or a dictionary (in which case it’s really the dictionary’s keys); x must be a character if y is a string; if y is a list, x could be of any type.

---

## 12.10. Composition Functions

This process of breaking a problem into smaller subproblems is called `functional decomposition`.

```py


1	  def square(x):
2	      y = x * x
3	      return y
4
5	  def sum_of_squares(x,y,z):
6	      a = square(x)
7	      b = square(y)
8	      c = square(z)
9
10	    return a+b+c
11
12	a = -5
13	b = 2
14	c = 10
15	result = sum_of_squares(a,b,c)
16	print(result)

Frames                  Objects
--------------------------------------
"Global frame"           "function"
        square	      square(x)
sum_of_squares	      sum_of_squares(x, y, z)
             a	-5
             b	2
             c	10
---------------------
"sum_of_squares"
             x	-5
             y	2
             z	10
             a	25
             b	4
---------------------
"square"
             x	10
             y	100
        Return
         value	100

two groups of local variables:
- square, sum_of_squares.
- Each group of local variables is called a stack frame.
- The variables x, y are local variables in both functions. but completely different variables, even though they have the same name. Each function invocation creates a new frame, and variables are looked up in that frame.
```


```py

1.

    def addit(x):
        return x+5
    def mult(x):
        return x*addit(x)

    print(mult(1))


2.

    def most_common_letter(s):
        frequencies = count_freqs(s)
        return best_key(frequencies)

    def count_freqs(st):
        d = {}
        for c in st:
            if c not in d:
                 d[c] = 0
            d[c] = d[c] + 1
        return d

    def best_key(dictionary):
        ks = dictionary.keys()
        best_key_so_far = list(ks)[0]  # Have to turn ks into a real list before using [] to select an item
        for k in ks:
            if dictionary[k] > dictionary[best_key_so_far]:
                best_key_so_far = k
        return best_key_so_far

    print(most_common_letter("abbbbbbbbbbbccccddddd"))
```

## 12.11. Flow of Execution Summary

`the flow of execution`: the order in which statements are executed.

### print vs return

the result of the function call

1. Save it for later.
  - Assigned to a variable. For example, w = square(3)
  - Put in a list. For example, L.append(square(3))
  - Put in a dictionary. For example, d[3] = square(3)

2. Use it in a more complex expression.
  - the return value as replacing the entire text of the function invocation.
  - For example:
  - w = square(square(3) + 7) - 5
  - return value 9 replacing the text square(3) in that invocation, so it becomes square(9 + 7) -5.

3. Print it for human consumption.
  - For example, print(square(3)) outputs 9 to the output area. Note that, unless the return value is first saved as in possibility 1, it will be available only to the humans watching the output area, not to the program as it continues executing.

---

## 15.4. 👩‍💻 Programming With Style

Readability is very important
- use 4 spaces for `indentation`
- `imports` should go at the top of the file
- `separate function` definitions with two blank lines
- keep `function definitions` together
- keep top level statements, including function calls, together at the bottom of the program


--

# example:

```py

1. count()

    def count(obj, lst):
        count = 0
        for e in lst:
            if e == obj:
                count = count + 1
        return count

2. in()

    def is_in(obj, lst):  # cannot be called in() because in is a reserved keyword
        for e in lst:
            if e == obj:
                return True
        return False

3. reverse()

    def reverse(lst):
        reversed = []
        for i in range(len(lst)-1, -1, -1): # step through the original list backwards
            reversed.append(lst[i])
        return reversed

4. find the index.

    def index(obj, lst):
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if lst[i] == obj:
                return i
        return -1

5. insert object in the index.

    def insert(obj, index, lst):
        newlst = []
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if i == index:
                newlst.append(obj)
            newlst.append(lst[i])
        return newlst


# 4. Write a function, test, that takes in three parameters: a required integer,
# an optional boolean whose default value is True, and an optional dictionary,
# called dict1, whose default value is {2:3, 4:5, 6:8}. If the boolean parameter is True,
# the function should test to see if the integer is a key in the dictionary.
# The value of that key should then be returned. If the boolean parameter is False, return the boolean value “False”.

def test(x, abool = True, dict1 = {2:3, 4:5, 6:8}):
    return abool and dict1.get(x, False)
```

## Storing Functions in Modules

```py
pizza.py:

def make_pizza(size, *toppings):
    print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")
```


1. Importing an Entire Module: `module.function()`

```py
import pizza
pizza.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
pizza.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```


2. Importing Specific Functions: `from module import function_0, function_1, function_2`

```py
from pizza import make_pizza

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

3. Using as to Give a Module an Alias: i`mport module as mn`

```py
import pizza as p

p.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
p.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

4. Using as to Give a Function an Alias: `from module import function as fn`

```py
from pizza import make_pizza as mp

mp(16, 'pepperoni')
mp(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```


5. Importing All Functions in a Module: `from module import *`

```py
from pizza import *
make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

# method

## 15.5. Method Invocations

one other special type of function called a `method`
- invoked slightly differently.
- Some object types have methods defined for them.
  - `strings` (e.g., find, index, split, join)
  - `lists` (e.g., append, pop).

To invoke a method:

`<expr>.<methodname>(<additional parameter values>)`
- The expression to the left of the dot should evaluate to an `object` of the correct type, an object for which <methodname> is defined.
- The method will be applied to that object (that object will be a parameter value passed to the function/method.)
- If the method takes additional parameters, additional expressions that evaluate to values are included inside the parentheses.

```py

1.
    y = "This is a sentence"
    z = y.split()
    print(type(z))    # <class 'list'>
    print(z)          # ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sentence']

2. The thing to the left of the period can be any expression, variable name, return value from other function call or method invocation.

    print("sentence".replace("s", "").replace("t", ""))
    #
    enence
```
