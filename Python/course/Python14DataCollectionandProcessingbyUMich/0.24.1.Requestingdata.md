## 24.3. Anatomy of URLs

A URL is used by a browser or other program to specify what server to connect to and what page to ask for.

URLs have specific formal structure: `<scheme>://<host>:<port>/<path>`

<font color=red> the scheme </font>:
- http or https.
- Other schemes that you will sometimes see include ftp (for file transfer) and mailto (for email addresses).

<font color=red> The host </font>: usually be a domain name, like `si.umich.edu` or `github.com` or `google.com`.
- When the URL specifies a domain name, the first thing the computer program does is look up the domain name to find the 32-bit IP address.
- For example, right now the IP adddress for github.com is 192.30.252.130. This could change if, for example, github moved its servers to a different location or contracted with a different Internet provider.
- Lookups use something called the Domain Name System, DNS. Changes to the mapping from domain names to IP addresses can take a little while to propagate: if github.com announces a new IP address associated with its domain, it might take up to 24 hours for some computers to start translating github.com to the new IP address.
- the host can be an IP address directly. This is less common, because IP addresses are harder to remember and because a URL containing a domain name will continue to work even if the remote server keeps its domain name but moves to a different IP address.

<font color=red> The :port </font>: optional.
- If it is omitted, the default port number is 80. The port number is used on the receiving end to decide which computer program should get the data that has been received. We probably will not encounter any URLs that include the : and a port number in this course.

<font color=red> The /path </font>: also optional. It specifies something about which page, or more generally which contents, are being requested.


example
- url: https://github.com/presnick/runestone:
- `https://`: use the secure http protocol
- `github.com`: connect to the server at github.com, which currently maps to the IP address 192.30.252.130. The connection will be made on the default port, which is 443 for https.
- `/presnick/runestone`: ask the remote server for the page `presnick/runestone`. It is up to the remote server to decide how to map that to the contents of a file it has access to, or to some content that it generates on the fly.

## 24.4. The HTTP protocol

A protocol specifies the order in which parties will speak and the format of what they say and the content of appropriate responses.

`HTTP` is the protocol that specifies *how web browsers or other programs communicate with web servers*. One version of the formal specification, before it was later split into multiple documents, was IETF RFC 2616.

1. **Step 1: the client makes a request to the server**
    1. `GET <path>`: If the request only involves fetching 取来 data, <font color=red> the client </font> sends <font color=dpurple> a message </font> of the form `GET <path>`,
    - `<path>` is the path part of the URL

    2. `POST`: If the request involves sending some data (e.g., a file upload, or some authentication information), <font color=dpurple> the message </font> starts with `POST`

    - In either case, <font color=red> the client </font>  sends some <font color=dpurple> HTTP headers </font>. These include:
      - The `type of client program`. This allows the server to send back different things to small mobile devices than desktop browsers (a “responsive” website)
      - Any `cookies` that the server previously asked the client to hold onto. This allows the server to continue previous interactions, rather than treating every request as stand-alone. It also allows ad networks to place personalized ads.

    - After the HTTP headers, for a POST type communication, there is <font color=dpurple> some data </font> (the body of the request).


2. **Step 2: the server responds to the client**
    - <font color=blue> The server </font> first sends back some <font color=dpurple> HTTP headers </font>. These include:
      - a `response code` indicating whether the server thinks it has fulfilled the request or not.
      - a `description` of the type of content it is sending back (e.g., text/html when it is sending html-formatted text).
      - any `cookies` it would like the client to hold onto and send back the next time it communicates with the server.
    - After the headers come the `contents`. This is the stuff that you would see if you ask to “View Source” in a browser.
