# Project 1. Alien Invasion.

> In this chapter, you’ll set up Pygame, and then create a rocket ship that moves right and left and fires bullets in response to player input.

> In the next two chapters, you’ll create a fleet of aliens to destroy, and then continue to refine the game by setting limits on the number of ships you can use and adding a scoreboard.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
- The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
- When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens.
- If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.
- If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.
- If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
