# 2.4. Function Calls

The Python interpreter can compute new values with function calls.
high school algebra: define a function `f` by specifying how it transforms an input into an output, `f(x) = 3x + 2`. Then, write `f(5)` and get the value 17.

Python adopts a similar syntax for invoking functions.
If there is a named function `foo` that takes a single input, we can *invoke foo on the value 5* by writing `foo(5)`.


`Functions` are like factories that take in some material`(arguments 内容提要 or inputs)`, do some operation, and then send out the resulting object`(output or return value)`.

> Note
Don’t confuse the “output value” of a function with the output window. The output of a function is a Python value and we can never really see the internal representation of a value. But we can draw pictures to help us imagine what values are, or we can print them to see an external representation in the output window.
To confuse things even more, print is actually a function. All functions produce output values. Only the print function causes things to appear in the output window.

```py
- square takes a single input parameter, and returns that input multiplied by itself. 
- sub takes two input parameters and returns the result of subtracting the second from the first.

print(sub(square(3), square(1+1)))
5

always have to resolve the expression inside the innermost parentheses first, in order to determine what input to provide when calling the functions.
