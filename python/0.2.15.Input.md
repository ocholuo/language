# 2.15. Input

n = input("Please enter your name: ")

The `input function` allows the programmer to provide a prompt string.

- When the function is evaluated, the prompt is shown (in the browser, look for a popup window).
- The user of the program can type some text and press return.
- When this happens the text that has been entered is returned from the input function, and assigned to the variable n.

the input function returns a **string value**.
