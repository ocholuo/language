configure a virtual IP address 192.168.20.1 on the Firewall.
- virtual IP address allows the Firewall to communicate with multiple IP networks from a single physical interface.

1. CMD: comfirm nothing assigned with the IP address 192.168.20.1: `ping 192.168.20.1`

>  `Destination not unreachable` and `possibly Request timed out`: the Client cannot reach anyone at that IP address.

> By default, the Client’s default gateway is 192.168.1.1, which is the Firewall `inside interface`.
> The responses come from 203.0.113.1: means the Firewall had no routes to the 192.168.20.0 network and forwarded those requests to its default gateway 203.0.113.1. From this information you can reasonably assume 192.168.20.1, for this lab environment, does not exist on the network.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-28 at 22.57.59](https://i.imgur.com/0ahzr02.png)

    - IP address: change it to `192.168.20.20`
    - Default gateway:` 192.168.20.1`
8.  CMD: `ping 192.168.20.1`

> The ping will fail
> because the Firewall’s virtual IP address, 192.168.20.1, has a network mask of /29 (255.255.255.248).
> The 192.168.20.0/29 network can only have an IP range of 192.168.20.1 – 192.168.20.6, 192.168.20.0 being the network address, 192.168.20.7 being the broadcast address.
> For the ping to succeed, the Client, configured for IP address of 192.168.20.20 does not fall in the IP range.

7. Start Menu > Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings > **internal**:
    - Properties: Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4): Properties button
    - IP: `192.168.20.6`
    - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.248

8.  CMD: `ping 192.168.20.1`

> The ping will now respond because the Client is in the same network as the Firewall’s virtual IP address.

6.  Click the `Refresh` icon in the upper-right of the Firewall administrator page to refresh the Captured Files section.
7.  Captured Files section, download the packet capture by clicking the pcap-1 filename in the File Name column.
8.  Once the pcap-1 file downloads, click on the pcap-1.pcap file, it will open in Wireshark.


### 5.2 Analyze PCAP Files with Wireshark

1. The first protocol you will analyze is DNS.
   - Review packets 1 and 2.
2. Observe packet 1.
   - Source is the Client (192.168.1.20)
   - Destination is 192.168.50.10.

> The Client is configured to use 127.0.0.1 as its DNS server.
> In this lab environment, the Client is running its own DNS server with the ability to forward requests to 192.168.50.10. This is the DMZ server, which is also running a DNS server.
> The Info column: a Standard query asking for the A record for www.panlabs.com.
> used Google Chrome to navigate to http://www.panlabs.com. The first step the Client does is to attempt to resolve www.panlabs.com to an IP address.

3. Observe packet 2.
   - the Source is the DMZ Server (192.168.50.10)
   - Destination is 192.168.1.20.

> is a Standard query response indicating the A record for www.panlabs.com has an IP address of 192.168.50.10.
> That is the DMZ server, which is also running a Web server hosting www.panlabs.com.
> Now that the Client knows the IP address of the original request, it can begin the request for a 3-way TCP handshake.

4. Review packets 3, 4, and 5. `TCP 3-way handshake`.

![Screen Shot 2020-05-28 at 23.43.39](https://i.imgur.com/tL3ee2o.png)


5. Observe packet 3.
   - the Source (the Client, 192.168.1.20) sends a TCP packet with the `flags SYN`, `ECN`, and `CWR` set in the header, to the Destination (the DMZ server, 192.168.50.10).
   - This establishes a `SYN (SYNchronize) packet` along with window size information.


6. Observe packet 4.
   - the Source (the DMZ server, 192.168.50.10) sends a TCP packet with the flags `SYN` and `ACK` set in the header, to the Destination (the Client, 192.168.1.20).
   - This establishes a `SYN-ACK (SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement) packet`. The DMZ server acknowledges the Client and sends back its own synchronization packet.

7. Observe packet 5.
   - the Source (the Client, 192.168.1.20) sends a TCP packet with the flag `ACK` set in the header, to the Destination (the DMZ server, 192.168.50.10).
   - This establishes an `ACK (ACKnowledgement) packet`. The Client acknowledges the DMZ server.
   - The Client and the DMZ server may begin communicating over TCP.


8.  Packets 3 – 45 represent a TCP Stream. When put together this represents the website, http://www.panlabs.com that you visited.
   - right-click on packet 3 and select Follow > `TCP Stream`.
   - Wireshark will assemble the packets associated with this TCP stream.

9. TCP Stream.
    - Notice the assembled packets represent the HTML website you visited.
