QUESTIONS

LEVEL 1 QUESTIONS:

```c
1) What is the IP address of the Windows VM that gets infected

    filter DHCP communication: "bootp" or "udp.port==67".
    filter: "http.request"
    The infected Windows VM IP address is 172.16.165.165

2) What is the host name of the Windows VM that gets infected

    frame -> DHCP Data -> Option: Host Name: K34EN6W3N-PC

3) What is the MAC address of the infected VM

    frame -> DHCP Data -> Client MAC address: f0:19:af:02:9b:f1 (f0:19:af:02:9b:f1)


4) What is the IP address of the compromised web site

    filter the GET requests "http.request.method == GET"
    frame -> HTTP Data -> Host: www.ciniholland.nl\r\n
    -> get 5 sites: Bing, leaving www.ciniholland.nl, adultbiz*in, 24corp-shop*com, stand.trustandprobaterealty*com.
    -> compromised website: www.ciniholland.nl, 82.150.140.30.

    The user visited “ciniholland” and through the referers of each GET requests, we see that it leads to a very suspicious website which initiates downloads on the machine.

5) What is the domain name of the compromised web site
    ciniholland.nl/

6) What is the IP address and domain name that delivered the exploit kit and malware
    its IP address is 37.200.69.143


7) What is the domain name that delivered the exploit kit and malware

    File->Export Object->HTTP
    -> Represents dll files, swf files, jar files, respectively
    -> so, stand.trustandprobaterealty.com 37.200.69.143
```

LEVEL 2 QUESTIONS:


```c
1) What is the redirect URL that points to the exploit kit (EK) landing page

    the exploit kit domain: stand.trustandprobaterealty.com
    filter: "tcp.stream eq 18"
    1079	22.647035	188.225.73.100	172.16.165.165	HTTP	1086		HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (text/html)
    open "Line-based text data: text/html (35 lines)"
    <html> \r\n
    [truncated]<body bgcolor=#ffffff><div align='center'><iframe src='http://stand.trustandprobaterealty.com/?PHPSSESID=njrMNruDMhvJFIPGKuXDSKVbM07PThnJko2ahe6JVg|ZDJiZjZiZjI5Yzc5OTg3MzE1MzJkMmExN2M4NmJiOTM' border=0 width=125 height=10 scro
    \r\n

    or

    File->Export Object->HTTP
    And find it in the extracted file:
    1074	22.627396	188.225.73.100	172.16.165.165	HTTP	1086	HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (text/html)
    After saving as a txt file, view the content and find
    So pointing to the EKs orientation (redirect, there is no translation into the redirect, because only the content of the page contains the pointing URL, not redirected) URL is http: 24corp-shop*com/


2) Beside the landing page (which contains the CVE-2013-2551 IE exploit), what other exploit(s) sent by the EK

    a Flash exploit and a Java exploit
    Media type: application/x-shockwave-flash (8227 bytes)
    Media type: application/java-archive (10606 bytes)


4) How many times was the payload delivered
    File->Export Object->HTTP->application/x-shockwave-flash
    3 times


5) Submit the pcap to VirusTotal and find out what snort alerts triggered.  What are the EK names are shown in the Suricata alerts
    Submit the file at www.virustotal.com/en to view the Suricata alerts information.

LEVEL 3 QUESTIONS:

```c
1) Checking my website, what have I (and others) been calling this exploit kit
    Rig EK
    Rig is similar to Infinity EK (originally identified as Goon in the spring of 2014). Some good info on Rig EK can be found at: http://www.kahusecurity.com/2014/rig-exploit-pack/


2) What file or page from the compromised website has the malicious script with the URL for the redirect

    1st malicious domain
    161	6.073686	172.16.165.165	82.150.140.30	HTTP	621	www.ciniholland.nl	GET / HTTP/1.1
    follow -> TCP stream
    Content-Encoding: gzip
    The index page for www.ciniholland.nl had the URL for http://24corp-shop .com/


3) Extract the exploit file(s).  What is(are) the md5 file hash(es)

    Flash exploit: 7b3baa7d6bb3720f369219789e38d6ab
    Java exploit: 1e34fdebbf655cebea78b45e43520ddf

    use a *nix command line tool
    or
    submit the files to Virus Total.



4) VirusTotal doesnt show all the VRT rules under the "Snort alerts" section for the pcap analysis. run your own version of Snort with the VRT ruleset as a registered user (or a subscriber), what VRT rules fire

    [1:30936:3] EXPLOIT-KIT Goon/Infinity/Rig exploit kit outbound uri structure
    [1:30934:2] EXPLOIT-KIT Goon/Infinity/Rig exploit kit encrypted binary download
    [1:25562:4] FILE-JAVA Oracle Java obfuscated jar file download attempt
    [1:27816:5] EXPLOIT-KIT Multiple exploit kit jar file download attempt

    Your results will very, depending on how you have your Snort installation configured. If you haven't tried to set up Snort on your own, check out some of the Snort Setup Guides at: https://www.snort.org/documents
