## CSV Format

CSV: Comma Separated Values.

```py
- The first line gives the column names
- the later lines each give the data for one row.

Name,score,grade
Jamal,98,A+
Eloise,87,B+
Madeline,99,A+
Wei,94,A
```

## 10.10. Reading in data from a CSV File

```py

1. to iterate over the CSV file lines.
   - values on each line are separated with commas or different column separator
   - to parse each line into a collection of separate value.
2. CSV format uses commas to separate but encloses all values in double quotes.
   - use the .split(','), .split('|') or .split('\\t').
   - header.strip().split(','): delete the front end space in the strings

       # file
       "Name","Sex","Age","Team","Event","Medal"
       "A Dijiang","M","24","China","Basketball","NA"
       "Edgar Lindenau Aabye","M","34","Denmark/Sweden","Tug-Of-War","Gold"
       "Christine Jacoba","F","21","Netherlands","Speed Skating, 1500M","NA"

       fileconnection = open("olympics.txt", 'r')
       lines = fileconnection.readlines()

       header = lines[0]
       field_names = header.strip().split(',')
       print(field_names)

       for row in lines[1:]:
           vals = row.strip().split(',')
           if vals[5] != "NA":
               print("{}: {}; {}".format(vals[0], vals[4], vals[5]))

```

## 10.11. Writing data to a CSV File


the `.write(str)` method: does not automatically insert a newline.
- have to `.write(\n)`: add the character `\n` at the end of each line.


```py


olympians = [("John Aalberg", 31, "Cross Country Skiing"),
             ("Minna Maarit Aalto", 30, "Sailing"),
             ("Win Valdemar Aaltonen", 54, "Art Competitions"),
             ("Wakako Abe", 18, "Cycling")]

outfile = open("reduced_olympics.csv", "w")

# output the header row
outfile.write('Name,Age,Sport')
outfile.write('\n')

# output each of the rows:
for olympian in olympians:

    row_string = '{},{},{}'.format(olympian[0], olympian[1], olympian[2])
    row_string = ','.join(olympian[0], olympian[1], olympian[2])

    outfile.write(row_string)
    outfile.write('\n')
outfile.close()

- .format(olympian) wouldnâ€™t work: because the interpreter would see only one value (a tuple) when it was expecting three values to try to substitute into the string template.
- .format(*olympian): an advanced technique for automatically unpacking the three values from the tuple.
