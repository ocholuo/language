```


## intro

some functions maybe repeated in code many times.

`function`:
- a chunk of code that performs some operation that is meaningful for a person to think about as a whole unit,
- a named sequence of statements.

---

## 12.2. Function Definition

creating a function, a function definition, is:

```py
def name( parameters ):
    statements

>>> print(type(name))
<class 'function'>
```

- the `parameters` specify what the function needs to do its work.
- There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the `def`.
- also a compound statements:
  - A `header` line: begins with a keyword `def`,  followed by the `name` of the function, and some `parameter` names enclosed in parentheses, and ends with a `colon`.
  - A `body`: consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same amount ‚Äì 4 spaces is the Python standard ‚Äì from the header line.
- `docstrings`
  - If the first thing after the function header is a string (some tools insist that it must be a triple-quoted string), it is called a `docstring` and gets special treatment in Python and in some of the programming tools.
  - Another way to retrieve this information: use the interactive interpreter, enter  `<function_name>.__doc__`, it will retrieve the `docstring` for the function.
  - So the string you write as documentation at the start of a function is retrievable by python tools at runtime. This is different from comments in your code, which are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.

By convention, Python programmers use docstrings for the key documentation of their functions.

## 12.3. Function Invocation

after define, to execute the function, use `function call/invocation`.

---

## 12.4. Function Parameters

```py
def name( formal/actual parameters / parameter values ):
    statements
```

This type of diagram is often called a `black-box diagram` because it only states the requirements from the perspective of the user
- The user must know the name of the function and what arguments need to be passed.
- The details of how the function works are hidden inside the ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù.


```py
def add(a,b):
    total = a+b
    a = 17   
    # string immutable, will not change
    return total

def add_list(alist):
    total = 0
    for i in alist:
      total+=i
    list.append("3")  
    # list mutable, will change
    return total

mynum=11
add(mynum, 3)  # (11,3) actual parameter
```

---

## 12.5. Returning a value from a function

`procedure`: function that doesn‚Äôt return a value.

`fruitful functions`: Functions that return values.
- The return statement is followed by an expression which is evaluated

```py
def name(parameter):
  statements
  return 3

get_value = name(parameter) = 3
# get the return value

def name(parameter):
  statements
  3
get_value = name(parameter) = None
# get None
```


A `return` statement, once executed, immediately terminates execution of a function, even if it is not the last statement in the function.
- Once the function gets to the return statement it will immediately stop executing the function.


```py

1.
    def weird():
        print("here")
        return 5
        print("there")
        return 10

    x = weird()
    print(x)

    when line 3 executes, the value 5 is returned and assigned to the variable x, then printed.
    Lines 4 and 5 never execute.

2.
    def longer_than_five(list_of_names):
        for name in list_of_names:
            if len(name) > 5: # as soon as you see a name longer than 5 letters,
                return True
                # then return True!
                # If Python executes that return statement, the function is over and the rest of the code will not run -- you already have your answer!
        return False
        # You will only get to this line if you
        # iterated over the whole list and did not get a name where
        # the if expression evaluated to True, so at this point, it's correct to return False!
    list1 = ["Sam","Tera","Sal","Amita"]
    list2 = ["Rey","Ayo","Lauren","Natalie"]

    print(longer_than_five(list1))
    print(longer_than_five(list2))

```

## 12.8. Variables and parameters are local¬∂

![Screen Shot 2020-03-21 at 14.21.05](https://i.imgur.com/1hVw556.png)

y=x*x, `return y`

avoid the temporary variable y: `return x*x`
- `temporary variables` inside are referred to as `local variables`

the `global variables` and the `local variables `for the square function are in separate boxes. can have same name.
- `local variable` only exists inside the function and you cannot use it outside.
- It is legal for a function to access a `global variable`. However, this is considered bad form and should be avoided.

```py
def square(x):
    y = x * x
    return y

z = square(10)
print(y)

NameError: name 'y' is not defined on line 6
```

---

### variable's scope:
- rule about how variables are looked up in Python.
- First, Python looks at the variables that are defined as `local variables` in the function. the `local scope`.
- If the variable name is not found in the `local scope`, then Python looks at the `global variables`, `global scope`.

```py

1. pass all parameter to the function:

    def badsquare(x):
        y = x ** power
        # 1. function should pass power as a parameter.
        return y
    power = 2
    result = badsquare(10)
    print(result)


2. local shadows the global.

    def powerof(x,p):
        power = p   # mistake
        y = x ** power
        return y
    power = 3
    7	result = powerof(10,2)

    Global frame:
    powerof	---   function powerof(x,p)
    power 	3
    result	100

the local shadows the global:
- a local variable has the same name as a global variable
- A shadow: means that the global variable cannot be accessed by Python because the local variable will be found first.
- This is another good reason not to use global variables. As you can see, it makes your code confusing and difficult to understand.


3. change the value of a global variable inside a function

    def powerof(x,p):
        global power # bad idea, but valid
        power = p    # mistake
        y = x ** power
        return y
    power = 3
    print(powerof(10,2))

    Global frame:
    powerof	---   function powerof(x,p)
    power 	2  
    # change the value of a global variable inside a function
    result	100
```

> Note
> Generally, we do not recommend making variables global.
> Imagine you are trying to write a program that keeps track of money while purchasing groceries. You may make a variable that represents how much money the person has, called wallet. You also want to make a function called purchase, which will take the name of the item and its price, and then add the item to a list of groceries, and deduct the price from the amount stored in wallet. If you initialize wallet before the function as a variable within the global scope instead of passing it as a third parameter for purchase, then an error would occur because wallet would not be found in the local scope. Though there are ways to get around this, as outlined in this page, if your program was supposed to handle groceries for multiple people, then you would need to declare each wallet as a global variable in the functions that want to use wallet, and that would become very confusing and tedious to deal with.
---

## 12.14. Side Effects

`side effect`
- Some lasting effect of a function call, other than its return value.
- Side effects include
  - `print statements`
  - `changes to mutable objects`
  - `changes to the values of global variables`

Side effects are sometimes convenient.
- For example
- have a single dictionary that accumulates information, and pass it around to various functions that modify it.

```py
1	def double(n):
2	   global y
3	   y = 2 * n
4
5	y = 5
6	double(y)
7	print(y)
```

but can be very difficult to debug.
- better way:

```py
1	def double(n):
2	   return 2 * n
3
4	y = 5
5	y = double(y)
6	print(y)
```

- You can avoid confusing `side effects` with `sharing of mutable objects`.
  - make a copy of an object and pass the copy in to the function.
  - Then return the modified copy
  - reassign it to the original variable to save the changes.

```py
1	def changeit(lst):
2	   lst[0] = "Michigan"
3	   lst[1] = "Wolverines"
4	   return lst
5
6	mylst = ['106', 'students', 'are', 'awesome']
7	newlst = changeit(list(mylst))
8	print(mylst)
9	print(newlst)
```

## 12.6. üë©‚Äçüíª Decoding a Function

build your understanding of any function:
- How many parameters does it have?
- What is the type of values that will be passed when the function is invoked?
- What is the type of the return value that the function produces when it executes?

some clues:
- `len(x)`: x must be a string/list/dictionary. x can‚Äôt be a number/Boolean.
- `x - y`: x and y must be numbers (integer or float)
- `x + y`: x and y must both be numbers/strings/lists.
- `x[3]`: x must be a string/list containing at least four items, or a dictionary that includes 3 as a key.
- `x['3']`: x must be a dictionary, with ‚Äò3‚Äô as a key.
- `x[y:z]`, x must be a sequence (string/list), and y and z must be integers.
- `x and y`, x and y must be Boolean
- `for x in y`, y must be a sequence (string/list) or a dictionary (in which case it‚Äôs really the dictionary‚Äôs keys); x must be a character if y is a string; if y is a list, x could be of any type.

---

## 12.10. Composition Functions

This process of breaking a problem into smaller subproblems is called `functional decomposition`.

```py


1	  def square(x):
2	      y = x * x
3	      return y
4
5	  def sum_of_squares(x,y,z):
6	      a = square(x)
7	      b = square(y)
8	      c = square(z)
9
10	    return a+b+c
11
12	a = -5
13	b = 2
14	c = 10
15	result = sum_of_squares(a,b,c)
16	print(result)

Frames                  Objects
--------------------------------------
"Global frame"           "function"
        square	      square(x)
sum_of_squares	      sum_of_squares(x, y, z)
             a	-5
             b	2
             c	10
---------------------
"sum_of_squares"
             x	-5
             y	2
             z	10
             a	25
             b	4
---------------------
"square"
             x	10
             y	100
        Return
         value	100

two groups of local variables:
- square, sum_of_squares.
- Each group of local variables is called a stack frame.
- The variables x, y are local variables in both functions. but completely different variables, even though they have the same name. Each function invocation creates a new frame, and variables are looked up in that frame.
```


```py

1.

    def addit(x):
        return x+5
    def mult(x):
        return x*addit(x)

    print(mult(1))


2.

    def most_common_letter(s):
        frequencies = count_freqs(s)
        return best_key(frequencies)

    def count_freqs(st):
        d = {}
        for c in st:
            if c not in d:
                 d[c] = 0
            d[c] = d[c] + 1
        return d

    def best_key(dictionary):
        ks = dictionary.keys()
        best_key_so_far = list(ks)[0]  # Have to turn ks into a real list before using [] to select an item
        for k in ks:
            if dictionary[k] > dictionary[best_key_so_far]:
                best_key_so_far = k
        return best_key_so_far

    print(most_common_letter("abbbbbbbbbbbccccddddd"))
```

## 12.11. Flow of Execution Summary

`the flow of execution`: the order in which statements are executed.

### print vs return

the result of the function call

1. Save it for later.
  - Assigned to a variable. For example, w = square(3)
  - Put in a list. For example, L.append(square(3))
  - Put in a dictionary. For example, d[3] = square(3)

2. Use it in a more complex expression.
  - the return value as replacing the entire text of the function invocation.
  - For example:
  - w = square(square(3) + 7) - 5
  - return value 9 replacing the text square(3) in that invocation, so it becomes square(9 + 7) -5.

3. Print it for human consumption.
  - For example, print(square(3)) outputs 9 to the output area. Note that, unless the return value is first saved as in possibility 1, it will be available only to the humans watching the output area, not to the program as it continues executing.

---

## example:

```py

1. count()

    def count(obj, lst):
        count = 0
        for e in lst:
            if e == obj:
                count = count + 1
        return count

2. in()

    def is_in(obj, lst):  # cannot be called in() because in is a reserved keyword
        for e in lst:
            if e == obj:
                return True
        return False

3. reverse()

    def reverse(lst):
        reversed = []
        for i in range(len(lst)-1, -1, -1): # step through the original list backwards
            reversed.append(lst[i])
        return reversed

4. find the index.

    def index(obj, lst):
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if lst[i] == obj:
                return i
        return -1

5. insert object in the index.

    def insert(obj, index, lst):
        newlst = []
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if i == index:
                newlst.append(obj)
            newlst.append(lst[i])
        return newlst
```
