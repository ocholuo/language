## Intro

Two dimensional tables have both rows and columns. You have probably seen many tables like this if you have used a spreadsheet program.

Another object that is organized in rows and columns is a `digital image`.
- A `digital image`: a finite collection of small, discrete picture elements called `pixels`.
- These `pixels` are organized in a two-dimensional grid 格子.
- Each `pixel` represents the smallest amount of picture information that is available.
- Sometimes these pixels appear as small “dots”.

Each `image (grid of pixels)` has its own width and its own height.
- The width is the number of columns and the height is the number of rows.
- name the pixels in the grid by using the column number and row number.
- start counting with 0!

## 7.8.1. The RGB Color Model

Each `pixel` of the image will represent a single color.
- The specific color depends on a formula that mixes various amounts of three basic colors: red, green, and blue. `RGB Color Model`.
- The amount of each color, called the `intensity of the color`, allows us to have very fine control over the resulting color.
- The minimum intensity value for a basic color is 0.
  - The closer to 0, the darker the color will appear.
- The maximum intensity is 255.
- This means that there are 256^3 distinct colors using the RGB Color Model.

In order to manipulate an image, need to be able to access individual pixels.
- This capability is provided by a module called `image`, provided in ActiveCode.
- The image module defines two `classes`: `Image` and `Pixel`.

Each `Pixel` object has three attributes: the `red intensity`, the `green intensity`, and the `blue intensity`.
- to ask for the intensity values. `getRed`, `getGreen`, and `getBlue`.
- to change an intensity value: `setRed`, `setGreen`, and `setBlue` methods.

## 7.8.2. Image Objects

To access the pixels in a real `image`, we need to first create an `Image` object.
- Image objects can be created in two ways.
    - image.`Image(filename)`: `img1=image.Image("cy.png")`
    - image.`EmptyImage(filename)`: `img2=image.EmptyImage(100,200)`

First, an `Image` object can be made from the files that store digital images.
- The `image` object has an attribute corresponding to the width, the height, and the collection of pixels in the image.

- An `EmptyImage` has a width and a height. However, the pixel collection consists of only “White” pixels.

- ask an `image` object to return its size using the `getWidth` and `getHeight` methods.
- get a pixel from a particular location in the image using `getPixel(col,row)`
- change the pixel at a particular location using `setPixel(col,row,p)`.

### `negative` image

A `negative` image simply means that each pixel will be the opposite of what it was originally.
- if the `original red component` was `50`, then the opposite, or `negative red value` would be `255-50` or `205`

```py

1. to see the resulting negative image.

      import image
      img = image.Image("luther.jpg")
      win = image.ImageWin(img.getWidth(), img.getHeight())
      img.draw(win)
      img.setDelay(1,15)   # setDelay(0) turns off animation
      # process each pixel in the image.
      for row in range(img.getHeight()):
          for col in range(img.getWidth()):
              # gets an individual pixel.
              p = img.getPixel(col, row)
              # create the negative intensity values
              newred = 255 - p.getRed()  
              newgreen = 255 - p.getGreen()
              newblue = 255 - p.getBlue()
              # create a new pixel
              newpixel = image.Pixel(newred, newgreen, newblue)

              img.setPixel(col, row, newpixel)
      img.draw(win)
      win.exitonclick()

2. Other pixel manipulation

For example, you can create a gray scale pixel by averaging the red, green and blue intensities and then using that value for all intensities.

From the gray scale you can create black white by setting a threshold and selecting to either insert a white pixel for a black pixel into the empty image.

You can also do some complex arithmetic and create interesting effects, such as Sepia Tone

## `ImageDraw` 模块
这个 ImageDraw 模块提供简单的二维图形 Image 物体。您可以使用此模块创建新图像、对现有图像进行注释或润色，以及动态生成图形以供Web使用。

## `ImageWin` 模块（仅限Windows）
这个 ImageWin 模块包含在Windows上创建和显示图像的支持。

ImageWin可以与pythonwin和其他用户界面工具包一起使用，这些工具包提供对Windows设备上下文或窗口句柄的访问。例如，tkinter通过winfo_id方法使窗口句柄可用：
