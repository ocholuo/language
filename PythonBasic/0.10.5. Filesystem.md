## 10.5. Finding a File in your Filesystem

`open('myfile.txt', 'r')`: all files sit in a single directory, and itâ€™s the same directory where the Python program is stored.

If file and Python program are in the same directory: can simply use the filename
- the file `myPythonProgram.py` could contain the code `open('data1.txt', 'r')`

If file and Python program are in different directories: need to specify a *path*.
- the file `myPythonProgram.py` could contain the code `open('../myData/data2.txt', 'r')`
to use an *absolute file path* (begins with a /)
- Python program running from any file folder could open data2.txt via `open('/Users/joebob01/myFiles/allProjects/myData/data2.txt', 'r')`.
