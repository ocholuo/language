## 8.1. Conditionals
- programs can be a series of `statements` which always execute sequentially or `operations` that are applied to each item in an iterable.
- Yet programs frequently need to be more subtle with their behavior. For example, a messaging app might only set a messageâ€™s title bold if it has not been read by the user. Or a video game needs to update the position of all the characters that are not asleep. This is done with something called a `selection` or a `conditional statement`.
