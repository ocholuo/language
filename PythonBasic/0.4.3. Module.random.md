# 4.3. The random module
use random numbers in programs:
- To play a game of chance where the computer needs to throw some dice, pick a number, or flip a coin,
- To shuffle a deck of playing cards randomly,
- To randomly allow a new enemy spaceship to appear and shoot at you,
- To simulate possible rainfall when we make a computerized model for estimating the environmental impact of building a dam,
- For encrypting your banking session on the Internet.

random number generators are based on a `deterministic algorithm` — repeatable and predictable.
- So they’re called `pseudo-random generators`, not genuinely random.
- computers don’t really generate random numbers, they generate pseudo-random numbers.
- They start with a seed value. get number based on the current seed attribute, and the state of the seed (which is one of the attributes of the generator) will be updated.
- each time run the program, the seed value is likely to be different.

1. `random()` function:
    - returns a floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0)
    - the square bracket means “closed interval on the left” and the round parenthesis means “open interval on the right”.


```py
import random

prob = random.random()
print(prob)
# return an float

diceThrow = random.randrange(1,7)       
# return an int, one of 1,2,3,4,5,6
# randrange(10) will give you numbers from 0-9.
print(diceThrow)

```

# module `Turtles`

Each turtles is an independent object, an `instance`, of the `Turtle type (class)`.

```py
import Turtles

// create a py object
wn = turtle.Screen()  # create a graphics window Screen, assign wm to Screen
alex=turtle.Turtle()  # create a turtle named alex

---
// Methods:
forward
left
right

// Attributes
color (black)  
heading
position (0.0)
width (2pcs)     
---

alex.forward(50)
alex.left(120)
alex.right(10)

// Attributes for object alex
wm.bgcolor("lightgreen")

// Attributes for object alex
alex.color("blue")     # color (black)
alex.pensize(3)        # set the width of her pen (2pcs)

wn.exitonclick()                # wait for a user click on the canvas
```
