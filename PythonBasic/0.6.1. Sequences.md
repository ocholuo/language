# 6.1. Introduction: Sequences


built-in types like: `int`, `float`, and `str`.
- `int` and `float` are considered to be simple or primitive or atomic data types because their values are not composed of any smaller parts. They cannot be broken down.
- `strings` and `lists` are different because they are made up of smaller pieces.
- `strings` are made up of smaller strings each containing one character.


Types that are comprised of smaller pieces are called *collection data types*.
