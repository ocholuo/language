## Hardware Overview

![Screen Shot 2020-04-10 at 18.07.28](https://i.imgur.com/xec510Z.png)

 CPU it is actually a circuit.
 - a highly sophisticated circuit with millions of `transistors` on it
 - three billion instructions per second.

we write `file.py` in secondary memory, secondary memory give the file in the main memory, and CPU calculate it and give the result.

## Python as a Language

Python = Monty Python's Flying Circus

Python for Everybody (PY4E): [material](https://www.py4e.com/lessons)

Python Development Environment
- Using Python on PythonAnywhere (Cloud / browser based - no installation required)
- Setting up the Python Environment in Microsoft Windows
- Setting up the Python Environment on a Macintosh
- You can also set up Python under Windows-10 using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if you prefer a Linux-like experience on your windows computer.
- Other cloud-provided Python environments include Trinket, Cloud9, or CodeAnywhere.

## Conditional Statements

conditional steps:
- `if Statements`
- comparison operators `==,!=,=<,....`

one-way decisions: `if`

nested decisions: `if: if: if`

two-way decisions: `if: else:`

multi-way decisions: `if: elif: else:`

traceback: `try/except`

```py
astr='bob'
try:
  print('hello')
  istr=int(astr)
  print('there')
except:
  istr=-1
print('done', istr)
```

---

## store and reuse

```py
def thing():
  Statements

thing()
```

## file

![Screen Shot 2020-04-10 at 20.10.40](https://i.imgur.com/0T5pav5.png)

```py

1.
    with open('mydata.txt', 'r') as md:
        print(md.readlines())    

2.
    afile = open("/../foo.txt", "w")
    afile.close()

```

**Reading files**

```py
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)


fhand.read(int/none)  -> a string
```

**Searching through a file**

```py

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')

for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)


# Skip 'uninteresting lines'
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    # Process our 'interesting' line
    print(line)


for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.find('@uct.ac.za') == -1: continue
    print(line)

```

**Letting the user choose the file name**

```py
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
fhand = open(fname)
count = 0

for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)

```

**Using try, except, and open**

What if our user types something that is not a file name?

```py
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
    exit()

count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)

```


**Writing files**

```py
fout = open('output.txt', 'w')
line1 = "This here's the wattle,\n"
fout.write(line1)
fout.close()

```

## Dictionary

**Dictionary as a set of counters**

```py
name=input("enter file:")
handle=open(name)
counts = dict()

for line in handle:
    words=line.split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1

bigcount=None
bigword=None

for word, count in counts:
    if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
        bigword=word
        bigcount=count
```

**Looping and dictionaries**

```py
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
for key in counts:
    print(key, counts[key])
```
