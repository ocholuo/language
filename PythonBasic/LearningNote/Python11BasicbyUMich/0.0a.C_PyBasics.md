## 1.2. Algorithms
An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.

Our goal in programming is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a general `solution`.

Once we have such a solution, we can `express it as a program` and use our computer to `automate the execution`. These programs are written in programming languages.

- high-level language: Py, C++, PHP, and java.
- low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages.

small disadvantage of high-level languages: ograms written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run, as computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages.

big disadvantage:
- less time to write.
- `portable`: they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.


Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: `interpreters` and `compilers`.

a compiler is like translating an entire book
an interpreter is like translating a line at a time

.

  - `interpreter`: reads a high-level program and executes it, it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.

  - `compiler`: reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running.
    - In this case, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable.
    - Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called `byte code`, and then interpreted by a program called a `virtual machine`.

Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.

## 1.5. More About Programs
A `program`: <font color=red> a sequence of instructions </font> that specifies how to perform a computation.
  - The computation might be something as complex as rendering an html page in a web browser or encoding a video and streaming it across the network.
  - It can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching for and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.

`input`
- Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.

`output`
- Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.

`math and logic`
- Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication and logical operations like `and, or, and not`.

`conditional execution`
- Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.

`repetition`
- Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.


## 1.6. Formal and Natural Languages
`Natural languages`: the languages that people speak, such as English, Spanish, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.

`Formal languages`: the languages that are designed by people for specific applications.
  - For example
  - the notation 记号, 标记法 that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.
  - Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:
  - Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.

`Syntax rules` come in two flavors, pertaining to `tokens` and `structure`.

  - `Tokens` are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements.
    - One of the problems with `3=+6$` is that `$` is not a legal token in mathematics.
    - Similarly, `2Zz` is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz.

  - The second type of syntax rule pertains to the `structure` of a statement, the way the tokens are arranged.
    - The statement `3=+6$` is structurally illegal because you can’t place a `plus sign` immediately after an `equal sign`.
    - Similarly, `molecular formulas` have to have subscripts after the element name, not before.

When read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called `parsing` 解析. figure out what it means, or the `semantics` of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will understand the general implication of this sentence.

Although formal and natural languages have many features in common — `tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics` — there are many differences:

`ambiguity 歧义`
- Natural languages are full of ambiguity.
- Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.


`redundancy`
- natural languages employ lots of redundancy. often verbose 冗长的.
- Formal languages are less redundant, more concise 简明的.

`literalness` /'litərəlnis/
- Formal languages mean exactly what they say.
- natural languages are full of idiom 成语 and metaphor 隐喻.
