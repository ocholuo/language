## 24.11. Searching for Media on iTunes

[official iTunes API documentation](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/).

In the Searching section of the documentation:
- the url should be in the form of https://itunes.apple.com/search?parameterkeyvalue
- the base url should be https://itunes.apple.com/search

To determine what parameters are necessary
- look at the table in the documentation to learn what parameter keys and values will be understood by the iTuens API server.

`term`: is a required parameter with no default value, have to provide that.



write our import statements, so that we have access to the requests module and json module.

```py

import requests
import json

parameters = {"term": "Ann Arbor", "entity": "podcast"}
iTunes_response = requests_with_caching.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search", params = parameters, permanent_cache_file="itunes_cache.txt")

py_data = json.loads(iTunes_response.text)
# no print
# found in permanent_cache


print(py_data)
#{'resultCount': 26,'results': [
#{'wrapperType': 'track', 'kind': 'podcast', 'collectionId': 1089272384, 'trackId': '1089272384', 'artistName': 'Ann Arbor District Library', 'collectionName': 'Ann Arbor Stories | Ann Arbor District Library', 'trackName': 'Ann Arbor Stories | Ann Arbor District Library',...},
#{'wrapperType': 'track', 'kind': 'podcast', 'collectionId': 156621464, 'trackId': '156621464', 'artistName': 'Vineyard Church of Ann Arbor', 'collectionName': 'Vineyard Church of Ann Arbor Sermon Podcast', 'trackName': 'Vineyard Church of Ann Arbor Sermon Podcast', ...},


for r in py_data['results']:
    print(r['trackName'])
#
# Arbor Stories | Ann Arbor District Library
# Vineyard Church of Ann Arbor Sermon Podcast
# Harvest Mission Community Church (Ann Arbor) Sermons
# Grace Bible Church Ann Arbor

## 24.12. Searching for tags on flickr

An API is available to make it easier for application programs to fetch data from the site and post data to the site. That allows third parties to make applications that integrate elements of flickr. Flickr provides the API as a way to increase the value of its service, and thus attract more customers. You can explore the official documentation about the site.

[documentation for photo search](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html)


The structure of a URL for a photo search on flickr is:
1. base URL is `https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/`
2. `?`
3. key=value pairs, separated by `&`s:
    - `method=flickr.photos.search`. This says to do a photo search, rather than one of the many other operations that the API allows. Don’t be confused by the word “method” here– it is not a python method. That’s just the name flickr uses to distinguish among the different operations a client application can request.
    - `format=json`: return results in JSON format.
    - `per_page=5`: return 5 results at a time.
    - `tags=mountains,river`: return things that are tagged with “mountains” and “river”.
    - `tag_mode=all`: return things that are tagged with both mountains and river.
    - `media=photos`: return photos
    - `api_key=....`: Flickr only lets authorized applications access the API. Each request must include a secret code as a value associated with api_key. Anyone can get a key. See the documentation for how to get one. We recommend that you get one so that you can test out the sample code in this chapter creatively. We have included some cached responses, and they are accessible even without an API key.
    - `nojsoncallback=1`: return the raw JSON result without a function wrapper around the JSON response.

>Note
>Searching for “mountains” and “rivers” usually produces beautiful images that are “safe for work”, so the example below does that search. We have already cached a response for the particular search in the code window below. That allows the code to run even if you don’t provide a valid flickr api_key. We’ve also checked to make sure that the five returned images are indeed safe for work. If you run this code outside of a browser, or if you do other searches, you will need to provide a valid flickr api_key.


```py

# import statements
import requests_with_caching
import json
# import webbrowser

# apply for a flickr authentication key at http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/?
# paste the key (not the secret) as the value of the variable flickr_key
flickr_key = 'yourkeyhere'

def get_flickr_data(tags_string):
    baseurl = "https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/"
    params_diction = {}
    params_diction["api_key"] = flickr_key # from the above global variable
    params_diction["tags"] = tags_string # must be a comma separated string to work correctly
    params_diction["tag_mode"] = "all"
    params_diction["method"] = "flickr.photos.search"
    params_diction["per_page"] = 5
    params_diction["media"] = "photos"
    params_diction["format"] = "json"
    params_diction["nojsoncallback"] = 1
    flickr_resp = requests_with_caching.get(baseurl, params = params_diction, permanent_cache_file="flickr_cache.txt")
    # Useful for debugging: print the url! Uncomment the below line to do so.
    print(flickr_resp.url) # Paste the result into the browser to check it out...
    return flickr_resp.json()
    # The response sent back by flickr is loaded into a python dictionary using json.loads().

result_river_mts = get_flickr_data("river,mountains")

# Some code to open up a few photos that are tagged with the mountains and river tags...

photos = result_river_mts['photos']['photo']

for photo in photos:
    owner = photo['owner']
    photo_id = photo['id']
    url = 'https://www.flickr.com/photos/{}/{}'.format(owner, photo_id)
    print(url)
    # webbrowser.open(url)
