# 13. Tuple 元组 Packing and Unpacking

[toc]

## 13.1. Introduction
tuples, a sequence type that works just like lists except that they are immutable.

When working with multiple `values` or multiple `variable names`, the Python interpreter does some `automatic packing and unpacking` to and from tuples, which allows some simplifications in the code you write.

## 13.2. Tuple Packing
Wherever python expects a `single value`, if multiple expressions are provided, separated by commas, they are *automatically packed into a tuple*.

Example

```py
1. omit the parentheses when assigning a tuple of values to a single variable.

    julia = ("Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009)
    # or equivalently
    julia = "Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009
    print(julia[4])
    2009
```

## 13.3. Tuple Unpacking

assignment statement:

`tuple of variable names` to be assigned values from a `tuple on the right of the assignment`.
- the tuple of values is unpacked into the variable names.

also works with `lists`, or any other sequence type, as long as there is exactly one value for each variable. For example, you can write `x, y = [3, 4]`.

```py

(variable names) = (values)

1.
    julia = "Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia"
    name, surname, birth_year, movie, movie_year, profession, birth_place = julia
    print(name)
    julia


2. variable names on the left side!!

    name, surname, birth_year, movie, movie_year, profession, birth_place="Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia"

    # "Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia" = name, surname, birth_year, movie, movie_year, profession, birth_place
    # SyntaxError: can't assign to literal on line 7


3. match

    (a, b, c, d) = (1, 2, 3)
    # ValueError: need more than 3 values to unpack
    (a, b, c, d) = (1, 2, 3, 4)


```

## 13.3.1. Swapping Values between Variables

```py
a = 1
b = 2
(a, b) = (b, a)
print(a, b)
#
2 1
```

## 13.3.2. Unpack tuple Into Iterator Variables

`Multiple assignment` with `unpacking` is useful to iterate through a list of tuples.
- can unpack each tuple into several loop variables.


```py
authors = [('Paul', 'Resnick'), ('Brad', 'Miller'), ('Lauren', 'Murphy')]
for first_name, last_name in authors:
    print("first name:", first_name, "last name:", last_name)

the tuple ('Paul', 'Resnick') is unpacked 解包 into the two variables first_name and last_name
```

## 13.5. Unpack tuples as Arguments to Function Calls

```py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

z = (5, 4)

# this line causes an error
print(add(z))

# this line will cause the values to be unpacked
print(add(*z))


```

## 13.3.3. Enumerate Items in a Sequence

```py

1. lists

    fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']

    for item in enumerate(fruits):

    # to unpack the tuples
    for idx, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
        print(idx, fruit)

2. dic

    pokemon = {'Rattata': 19, 'Machop': 66, 'Seel': 86, 'Volbeat': 86, 'Solrock': 126}

    # .items() !!!!!
    # .items() dictionary method produces a sequence of tuples.

    for key, value in pokemon.items():

```

---

## 13.4. Tuples as Return Values

```py
def name(x):
  statement
  return (c,a)  # same
  return [c,a]  # same
  return c,a    # same

It’s common to unpack the returned values into multiple variables.

c.value, a.value = name(x)
# c.value = c
# a.value = a
```
