### 21.1.2. Code One Section at a Time

After you outline your program, you should write code one section at a time, and carefully test that section before you go on.

find the right python code to express idea:

1. **pulling out an item from a list or string or dictionary?** <font color='green'> use [] to pull out the item you want. </font>

2. **transforming a string into another string?** <font color='green'> summary of string methods. </font>

3. **modifying a list?** <font color='green'> material on lists. </font>

4. **doing something multiple times?** <font color='green'> for loop. </font>

    ```py
    for <varname> in <seq>:
                    <code block line 1>
                    <code block line 2>
                    ...
    ```

5. **something that should only occur in some circumstances and not in others?** <font color='green'> if statement. </font>

    ```py
    if <boolean exp>:
      <if block here>
      ...
    else:
      <else block here>
      ...
    ```

6. **accumulator pattern?** <font color='green'> making a skeleton version of it, and then fill it in. </font>

    ```py
    #initialize accumulator
    a = <initial value>

    for <varname> in <seq>:
      <some code in for block>
      a = <new_value>
      <other code in for block>
    print(a)
    ```

## 21.1.3. Clean Up

No one really needs to see the test statements you wrote, and leaving test statements in the program might confuse when add more to the program.

only limit comments.
